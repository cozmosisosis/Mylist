FIXED   When adding items from group, if one of the quantities of items is not filled out the operation fails.
FIXED   Combine pages edit groups and my groups into one page.

        Error when adding from group, if error occurs nothing happens (change a value to an invalid one and try submiting) need to decide on what system to ajax or load new page.
        Error caused by mixing up my groups and edit groups resources seen when adding item to group from edit group page
        Adding all ingredients button doesnt work.
        Change method for updating page data, change from replacewith function to innerHTML to avoid repetation of div with id tag.
        Turn repeated sections into functions to simplify code 
        Give each page it own route that will display error if one exists.

        DIFFERENT ISSUE OR IDEA

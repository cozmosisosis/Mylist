FIXED   When adding items from group, if one of the quantities of items is not filled out the operation fails.

        Error caused by mixing up my groups and edit groups resources seen when adding item to group from edit group page.
        Combine pages edit groups and my groups into one page.
        Adding all ingredients button doesnt work.
        Change method for updating page data, change from replacewith function to innerHTML to avoid repetation of div with id tag.
        Extrapolate functions out ex: item/group verification. 
        Give error page its own route.

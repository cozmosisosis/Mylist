 This DIR is for my application Mylist. This application is for simplifying and expiditing the process of making lists that you have made many times over. EX: grocery list, chores etc.
 The application remembers all items you add to your list and items can be grouped so as to be automically added when wanted. EX: For weekly chores everything could be added to the list
 just by selecting weekly chores (mow lawn, do laundry, take out the trash etc). For things like a recipe all ingredients could be added by selecting the recipe for example pizza (flour, tomato sauce
 , cheese, pepperoni etc).

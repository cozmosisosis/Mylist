        Autofocus does not work after ajax method is used, only on page first load.
        Error when adding from group, if error occurs nothing happens (change a value to an invalid one and try submiting) need to decide on what system to ajax or load new page.
        Adding all ingredients button works but I want it to redirect to the homepage.
        Change method for updating page data, change from replacewith function to innerHTML to avoid repetation of div with id tag.
        Turn repeated sections into functions to simplify code 
        Give each page it own route that will display error if one exists.
